# LODBook 3

Continuing experiments in developing online historical narratives that embed rich structured data. See my [research notebook](https://timsherratt.org/research-notebook/lodbooks/) for past attempts.

This version of LODBook consists of two major components:

* a Jekyll plugin that creates LOD links between a series of texts and a data file, and then generates a web site with embedded JSON-LD
* a Jekyll theme that encourages users to explore connections between text and data

Eventually I'd like to separate these components into separate Ruby gems, but for the moment everything's lumped in here.

Documentation coming soon...
